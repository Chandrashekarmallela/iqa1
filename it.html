<p3><b>2. What is a class?</b></p3>
<p4>Answer:
A class is a blueprint from which objects are created. A class contains methods and variables associated with an instance of a class.
</p4>


<p5><b>3.What is an object?</b></p5>
<p6>Answer:
An object is an instance of a class. For example
class Abc{ —– This is a class
int a; —— This is a variable
public Abc(); —- This is contractor
public static void main (String args[]) ——- This is a method
{
Abc a= new Abc(); —— This is object creation where ‘a’ is the reference variable or object name
}
}
</p6>


<p7><b>4. What is a constructor?</b></p7>
<p8>Answer:
A constructor is methods which are used to create an Object of class. There are two types of constructor Default & Parameterized constructor.
</p8>


<p9><b>5. What is the different OOPS principle?</b></p9>
<p10>Answer:
The basic OOPS principle are as follows,
•	Encapsulation
•	Abstraction
•	Inheritance
•	Polymorphism
</p10>


<p11><b>6. What is inheritance?</b></p11>
<p12>Answer:
Inheritance is property in which the property of a parent class(Superclass) is passed on to child class(Subclass). For example
class Abc{ —– This is a class
int a; —— This is a variable
public void abc(){} — Methods
}
class Xyz extends Abc —–(Extend is the keyword, Xyz is the subclass which inherits the properties of ABC parent class.)
{
public static void main (String args[]) ——- This is a method
{
Abc a= new Abc(); —— This is object creation where ‘a’ is the reference variable or object name
}
}
</p12>


<p13><b>7. What is polymorphism?</b></p13>
<p14>Answer:
Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on multiple forms. Most commonly polymorphism is used in OOP when a parent class reference is used to refer to a child class object.
</p14>


<p15><b>8. What are the instance and class variables?</b></p15>
<p16>Answer:
Instance variable belongs to a particular instance of that class whereas Class variable. A class variable is also known as static variables. For example
public class Abc{
public int a; …….. This is an instance variable
public static int a1;…….. This is a static or class variable
……………………..
……………..
}
</p16>


<p17><b>9.Compare method and constructor?</b></p17>
<p18>Answer:
Constructor: Used to initialize the instance of a class.
Method: Used to perform some function or operation.
Constructor: Doesn’t have a return type.
Method: Has a return type.
</p18>


<p19><b>10. What is a singleton class?</b></p19>
<p20>Answer:
Singleton class limits the number of objects created for a class to one but gives the flexibility of creating more objects if the situation changes.
