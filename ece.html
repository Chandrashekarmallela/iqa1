<p1><b>Q1. What is Electronics?</b></p1>
<p2>Ans: The study and use of electrical devices that operate by controlling the flow of electrons or other electrically charged particles.</p2>


<p3><b>Q2. What is the difference between Electronics and Electrical?</b></p3>
<p4>Ans: Electronics work on DC and with a voltage range of -48vDC to +48vDC. If the electronic device is plugged into a standard wall outlet, there will be a transformer inside which will convert the AC voltage you are supplying to the required DC voltage needed by the device. Examples: Computer, radio, T.V, etc...
Electric devices use line voltage (120vAC, 240vAC, etc...). Electric devices can also be designed to operate on DC sources, but will be at DC voltages above 48v. Examples: are incandescent lights, heaters, fridge, stove, etc...
</p4>


<p5><b>Q3. What is communication?</b></p5>
<p6>Ans: Communication means transferring a signal from the transmitter which passes through a medium then the output is obtained at the receiver. (or)communication says as transferring of message from one place to another place called communication.</p6>


<p7><b>Q4. Different types of communications? Explain.</b></p7>
<p8>Ans: Analog and digital communication.
As a technology, analog is the process of taking an audio or video signal (the human voice) and translating it into electronic pulses. Digital on the other hand is breaking the signal into a binary format where the audio or video data is represented by a series of "1"s and "0"s.
Digital signals are immune to noise, quality of transmission and reception is good, components used in digital communication can be produced with high precision and power consumption is also very less when compared with analog signals.
</p8>


<p9><b>Q5. What is latch up?</b></p9>
<p10>Ans: Latch-up pertains to a failure mechanism wherein a parasitic thyristor (such as a parasitic silicon controlled rectifier, or SCR) is inadvertently created within a circuit, causing a high amount of current to continuously flow through it once it is accidentally triggered or turned on. Depending on the circuits involved, the amount of current flow produced by this mechanism can be large enough to result in permanent destruction of the device due to electrical overstress (EOS) .</p10>


<p11><b>Q6. What is diode?</b></p11>
<p12>Ans: In electronics, a diode is a two-terminal device. Diodes have two active electrodes between which the signal of interest may flow, and most are used for their unidirectional current property.</p12>


<p13><b>Q7. What is transistor?</b></p13>
<p14>Ans: In electronics, a transistor is a semiconductor device commonly used to amplify or switch electronic signals. The transistor is the fundamental building block of computers, and all other modern electronic devices. Some transistors are packaged individually but most are found in integrated circuits</p14>


<p15><b>Q8. What is sampling?</b></p15>
<p16>Ans: The process of obtaining a set of samples from a continuous function of time x(t) is referred to as sampling.</p16>


<p17><b>Q9. State sampling theorem.</b></p17>
<p18>Ans: It states that, while taking the samples of a continuous signal, it has to be taken care that the sampling rate is equal to or greater than twice the cut off frequency and the minimum sampling rate is known as the Nyquist rate.</p18>


<p19><b>Q10. What are the advantages of resistors?</b></p19>
<p20>Ans:
•	Resistors are very small in size.
•	It is very easy to carry resistors from one place to another place.
•	Resistors are very cheap.
