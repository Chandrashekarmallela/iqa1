<p1><b>How do you measure concrete?</b></p1>
<p2>Cubic feet, Cubic yards, Cubic Meter</p2>


<p3><b>Which is stronger solid steel rod or hollow steel pipe?</b></p3>
<p4>On a per pound basis, steel pipe is stronger in bending and is less likely to buckle in axial compression.</p4>


<p5><b>What is the tallest man made structure in the world?</b></p5>
<p6>The tallest man made structure is the KVLY-TV mast which is 2063 feet tall. The worlds tallest man made structure is Burj Dubai which is 800 meter tall.</p6>


<p7><b>What is braced excavation all about?</b></p7>
<p8>Excavations are braced to prevent the cave-in of surrounding unstable soil.</p8>


<p9><b>What is the meaning of soil reinforcement?</b></p9>
<p10>Soil reinforcement is the act of improving soil strength to enable it support or carry more load.

Two common examples are:

a) Mixing a soil amendment such as lime into weak clayey soil and re-comPActing to improve soil-bearing caPAcity (often done under the road base in highway construction)

b) Installing plastic or composite webbing layers (called geo-grid material) alternating with comPActed soil to produce a stronger sloped soil structure (often done on steep roadway embankments to improve strength and stability)
</p10>


<p11><b>What is aggregate?</b></p11>
<p12>Aggregate is the component of a composite material used to resist compressive stress.</p12>


<p13><b>What year was the keystone power plant in Indiana County constructed?</b></p13>
<p14>1967 began commercial operation on unit 1.</p14>


<p15><b>What is the force exerted by the Tacoma narrows bridge?</b></p15>
<p16>The force exerted to the Tacoma narrows bridge was initially the wind resistance. The wind resistance caused the whole bridge to act as a system with forced vibration with damping.</p16>


<p17><b>What are the uses of alloys in daily life and how are alloys made?</b></p17>
<p18>Alloying is not always done to produce a 'superior' material, but to produce materials having a desired requirement in the industry or elsewhere. A classic case is of lead solder (containing lead & tin),in which the melting point of the constituent elements are lowered, not necessarily a desirable property.

Alloying can be carried out using hot press method (a sheet of material is sandwiched with alloying material),rolling the heated base metal in a drum full of alloying metal powder, using hot spraying, galvanizing (dipping the base in a molten solution of alloying material) etc. Sometimes the alloying material is added in small proportions to the molten base metal (e.g., in production of different types of steel).

10 What is the worlds largest concrete dam?
The Grand Coulee Dam is said to be the largest concrete dam. Currently the world's largest concrete dam is the Itaipu Dam, an accomplishment of two neighboring countries, Brazil and Paraguay in South America.

Though it is not finished yet, the Three Gorges (or Sandapong) Dam on the Yangtze River in China will take over as the largest upon its completion, which is slated for 2009.
</p18>



<p19><b>What are the main reasons of building collapse?</b></p19>
<p20>There are several reasons for building collapse. Passage of time is the main reason. Also, weak foundations, natural calamities like earthquakes, hurricanes, etc., are the major reasons for building collapse. Bombing and destruction is also another major reason.</p20>
